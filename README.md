# Pokémon Explorer Web App

Welcome to the Pokémon Explorer web app! This app allows users to explore detailed information about their favorite Pokémon using the PokeAPI. The app features dynamic routing, a clean UI with React Router DOM, and a responsive layout built with Bootstrap.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Displays a list of Pokémon with a search feature.
- **Dynamic Pokémon Detail Page**: Displays detailed information about each Pokémon, including:
  - Name, ID, and type(s)
  - Pokémon's base stats (e.g., HP, Attack, Defense)
  - Abilities, including hidden abilities
  - Pokémon’s moveset
  - Images and sprites of the Pokémon
  - Evolution chain (future use)
- **Tabs for Information**: Toggle between Base Stats, Abilities, and Moves.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing between the homepage and individual Pokémon detail pages.
- **Axios**: For fetching data from the PokeAPI.
- **React Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and UI components.
- **Animate.css**: For adding smooth animations and transitions.
- **PokeAPI**: The free API providing data about Pokémon.
- **React's `lazy` function**: Used for code-splitting and loading components dynamically, improving performance by only loading components when needed.
